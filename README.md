# AXMediaUpload

Support easy image and video uploads within your app.

**NOT READY FOR PRIMETIME JUST YET**

I'm currently working to pull out some useful components from scraped app ideas I've had. As such this still is a bit of a WIP, and will take some TLC to remove any extraneous dependencies it one had on other code.

The code requires AFNetworking, which I'd recommend you install via CocoaPods (which is what I'm doing locally). I plan to package this up a bit nicer one I stop editing it so heavily.
